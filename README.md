# TS Type Validators

There are a ridiculous amount of Typescript type validation libraries. Each has its advantages and disadvantages and usually was formed out of previous pains with another library.

This repository is meant to hold an exhaustive comparison of Typescript type validation libraries to help you choose the one that's right for you.

## Goals

The primary goal is to write a common list of problems that are solved with these libraries and then provide their solution using all of the validation libraries. This makes it easy to compare each library against another.

**NOTE: We'll also include a "typescript" example which uses just raw TS to write the same validation.**
